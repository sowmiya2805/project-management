# ProjectMgmt CRUD App

### Very simple CRUD app using GraphQL and MERN stack.

I built this following Brad Traversy's tutorial. It was a fun project to build, and my first experience with GraphQL and MongoDB.

Simply clone the repository and browse into the directory, and run

`npm install`

then boot up the server environment using:

`npm start`

and the client with:

`cd client`

`npm install`

`npm run start`
